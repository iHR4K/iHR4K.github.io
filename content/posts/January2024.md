Takeshi Kitano used this word as a name for his movie, one time he explained the meaning as the point of decision-making for musicians, like at some point musician should play a sonatine and make a decision about where to move forward - jazz, classic, etc

It feels like my sonatine was a few weeks ago - it was nothing special, I just woke up as usual and realized I wanted to make a game, prove my knowledge and finally show my commitment to game dev, while I wanted to implement only tech demos, this will be a game with the release for Microsoft platform - PC and Xbox,

So that's the first record in my blog about Project little-u, a few days ago I started writing ideas, and concepts and already wrote some code for the editor,

I know what I am able to do and my budget, so I can't rely on animations and music, so I have other ideas on how to go around that technical limitation which are probably pretty unique(always hard to say in our world),

Good luck to future me :)
