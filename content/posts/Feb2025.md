One year has passed, it was a really interesting year with good and sad moments.
Last month I was working on the architecture of the engine, I made it based on the Lua script, and that's really interesting how different is the point of view when CPP does nothing but only respond to the calls,
That turned into a completely different prefabs/assets loading system and different renderer. Also, I added Bullet Physics, that's pretty easy - just don't forget to reactivate bodies - they can go to sleep.
As a consequence,e I wanted to make a small game - paddle ball. It went well and here is the small demo: (here is the source for the idea and geometry https://www.kodeco.com/2606-bullet-physics-tutorial-getting-started)

Here are some examples of Lua api - Script, Physics, Input are modules on the engine level. You can see how easy code looks and I can change the game in runtime and also I can write completely another game until that's from 80s :)

The Lua script showed all my weaknesses, like memory management and how to work with rendering commands optimally, so I decided to read the Game Engine Architecture book. It's a really great book. If you have never read it, be sure to grab one.
I also have a few good book recommendations about engine architecture - I will share them once I am sure they are good. Probably on the Twitter - https://x.com/iHR4K
Good luck.
