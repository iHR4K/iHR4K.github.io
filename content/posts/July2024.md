Sorry, it's slightly late because I was sick, by the way finally I swept another page in my rendering life :)
At the beginning of June, I started moving my RT code to Editor, and when I completed it I realized how bad it looks, so I wanted to find the reason and started digging in.
To be sure I draw everything correctly I implemented that famous "RT in one weekend". Not w/o help from the internet, but mostly on my own. That was a really good experience; if you want to understand some things, you better try it. I put my code in a public repo, so you can check it if you would like - https://github.com/iHR4K/Ray-Tracing-in-One-Weekend-with-DXR
Pay attention to comments, I wanted to give some useful information other DXR demos often don't point to, e.g. InstanceContributionToHitGroupIndex is really important when you have different instances.
Later I got a previewer with valid data, and I wanted to provide a progressive update for the view, so I found this article Correlated Multi-Jittered Sampling by Andrew Kensler https://graphics.pixar.com/library/MultiJitteredSampling/paper.pdf
With that, I was able to get some really interesting results for simple baking. I replaced my old baker's renderer with this one and immediately realized my planes don't use anything but normal to sample environment,

So that's probably my task for the next few days - check Karis' implementation, I probably missed something.

Right after this, I will start implementing Irradiance Fields, that should be amazing
