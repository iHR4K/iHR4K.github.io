Grand finale, I gained a lot of new knowledge, amazing technique, and good results (at least for me). So the one thing I can share is to pay attention to coordinate systems - the calculation of the position of the grid relies on the right coordinate system.

So for now I want to switch to another important component - the component system :) This month I will be researching CRYENGINE to learn about real engine architecture. I also will take a look at Lua since they use it in their engine, and maybe OpenGOAL. I always wanted to try it.

That's it for this month, good luck and see you :)
