I have never worked with GI algorithms, and that's a new huge world for me. And I liked it, by the way, that's really huge world. So I started with a few different roads: Spherical Harmonics, Ray Tracing and Irradiance Fields. 
Probe generation was a little new field either, after the first look at the GDC talk from Remedy, I thought I would need voxels, but it turned out I could go with simple discretization of the space. It works well and is very effective.

I have probes that were generated from the current scene, but they don't account for second bounds and interreflections, so I decided to go with a better solution for probe generation and so I restored my RayTracing research code in my new editor. 
Also to make the preview I implemented a special "Preview Window" in Editor, so I can select another renderer and render the current scene with Ray Tracing for example.

Spherical Harmonics is really my favorite topic, I really adore the fact of how they work, because I really love the math behind it. So I'm implementing efficient encoding of low freq lighting right now, and I hope I will finish soon.
And here is the talk what I really liked and I will implement it probably right after my current task
