      <description>Takeshi Kitano used this word as a name for his movie, one time he explained the meaning as the point of decision-making for musicians, like at some point musician should play a sonatine and make a decision about where to move forward - jazz, classic, etc
It feels like my sonatine was a few weeks ago - it was nothing special, I just woke up as usual and realized I wanted to make a game, prove my knowledge and finally show my commitment to game dev, while I wanted to implement only tech demos, this will be a game with the release for Microsoft platform - PC and Xbox,</description>
